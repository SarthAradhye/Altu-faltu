        <h2>Dear Nidhi,</h2>
        <p> Writing this letter to you so that I can communicate with you. Hope you ware well and healthy and your mood is nice. I was furious when your snap was vanished and hence I
            bombared messages on hunch as I was furious but at the same time tensed.
            Because it is hard for any girl to share private pictures and we both had shared our pics. And first though
            which came into my mind was that your
            family got hint about it hence you are in problem. Listen be calm and remember I am always there for you
            always and please bataya karo yaar
            tension ata hai!😭. And ha suno wednesday ke pehle snap ya insta se ya wp pe contact karo. Tumhari yaad aa
            rahi hai😭🥹. And yes I want gifts ha. And listen my mobile number is linked below phone se website dekh rahi ho toh you can call.
            <br>
            <br>
            Love you,
            Yours Sarth.
